# Moorhuhn_RLE2BMP
Converts .rle texture sprites to .bmp from Moorhuhn Schatzjäger games.

Currently only tested with Moorhuhn Schatzjäger 1.

# Usage
Drag and drop your .rle file into Moorhuhn_RLE2BMP.exe

Done! Now you will find each frame of the animation as .bmp in the directory where your .rle file is.
